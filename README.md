# Managing Huge Worlds

## Project Overview 
In this project, we are learning how to manage open worlds, within Unity and how to keep the game performing well. This is a small project to test this concept of hiding parts of the world and the objects in that area and showing them again when the player gets close.

In this project, we will cover the following topics:
- **Arrays**
- **Hiding Objects**
- **Collecting Player's Location**

Assets used by **Bundysoft - L3DT**.

Check the **Releases** for the final project.

This Project is now closed!
